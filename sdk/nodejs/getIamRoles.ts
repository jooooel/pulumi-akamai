/**
 * Use `akamai.getIamRoles` to list roles for the current account and contract type. The account and contract type are determined by the access tokens in your API client. Use the `roleId` from this data source to construct the `authGrantsJson` when creating or updating a user's auth grants.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const my-roles = akamai.getIamRoles({});
 * export const roles = my_roles;
 * ```
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * These attributes are returned:
 *
 * * `roles` â€” A list of roles.
 *
 * [API Reference](https://techdocs.akamai.com/iam-api/reference/get-roles)
