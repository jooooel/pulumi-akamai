/**
 * Use the `akamai.getCpsWarnings` data source to return a map of all possible pre- and post-verification warnings. The map includes both the ID needed to acknowledge a warning and a brief description of the issue.
 *
 * CPS produces warnings during enrollment creation or after a client uploads the certificate. CPS won't process a change until you acknowledge all warnings.
 *
 * You can use the warning IDs returned by this data source to acknowledge or auto-approve warnings. The `akamai.CpsThirdPartyEnrollment` and `akamai.CpsUploadCertificate` resources include arguments to help you do this.
 *
 * ## Basic usage
 *
 * This example shows how to return a map of verification warnings:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as akamai from "@pulumi/akamai";
 *
 * const example = akamai.getCpsWarnings({});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * This data source returns this attribute:
 *
 *   * `warnings` - Validation warnings for the current change you're making. Warnings display with an ID and a short description. Unless you auto-approve warnings, you need the ID to acknowledge the change. CPS won't process the change until you acknowledge these warnings.
