        /// 
        /// This example shows how to return a map of verification warnings:
        /// 
        /// ```csharp
        /// using System.Collections.Generic;
        /// using Pulumi;
        /// using Akamai = Pulumi.Akamai;
        /// 
        /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
        /// {
        ///     var example = Akamai.GetCpsWarnings.Invoke();
        /// 
        /// });
        /// ```
        /// 
        /// ## Attributes reference
        /// 
        /// This data source returns this attribute:
        /// 
        ///   * `warnings` - Validation warnings for the current change you're making. Warnings display with an ID and a short description. Unless you auto-approve warnings, you need the ID to acknowledge the change. CPS won't process the change until you acknowledge these warnings.
